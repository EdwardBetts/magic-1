= magic

Ruby FFI wrapper to the "magic" library, that determines content type
and encoding of files and strings. The library does three types of
tests: filesystem tests, magic number tests, and language tests. The
first test that succeeds causes the file type to be returned.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future
  version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want
  to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit
  by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
